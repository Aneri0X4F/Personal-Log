This time is very sm all and hence we see it like all the processes are running parallely.\n* Thus, when one process goes away and other process needs to be loaded, this is called process switching.\n* Process switching is totally different than mode switching. In a process execution, there may occur mode switching. \n* Mode switching means switching from user to kernal mode vice versa.\n\n> So why is process gets switched?\n* ![](/assets/images//assets/images/2021-09-06-08-23-14.png)\n\n* Reasons for switching (Eg.)\n    * Clock interrupt (time slice expired)\n    * I/O Interrupt (an event occured)\n    * Memory fault (trap) - Accessing memory which is not available.\n\n* Mode Switching - When a running process changes its mode from one to other.\n    * While switching the mode, processor state information of PCB is saved (user to kernel) and restored back (kernel to user).\n    * Mode switch, thus becomes the subset of prcess switch.\n    * Thus, process switch will take more time then mode switch.\n* Steps in process switch\n    * ![](/assets/images//assets/images/2021-09-06-08-28-44.png)\n\n> Is OS a process?\n* Basically OS is a code/program which is in between hardware and application that we run.\n* Designs of OS to explain execution of OS\n    * ![](/assets/images//assets/images/2021-09-06-08-33-06.png)\n\n## Different designs\n* Non-process (seperate krnal)\n    * Kernel\n    * kernel was not aconsidered as process since it had its own data struct etc.\n* Execution within User Processes\n    * ![](/assets/images//assets/images/2021-09-06-08-36-42.png)\n    * no witching of process.\n    * each process had seperate OS and kenel was implemented directly. \n\n* Process-based OS\n    * ![](/assets/images//assets/images/2021-09-06-08-37-48.png)\n    * More like microkernel architecture.\n\n## Process management in UNIX SVR4\n* SVR4 stands for System V Release 4.\n* **Most** of the the OS executes in user process.\n* System processes - Kernel mode only\n* User Processes\n    * User mode to execute user programs and utilities.\n    * Kernel mode to execture instructions that belong to kernel\n* Process with ID 0 = Linux boots and creates a **swapper** process which in turn creates init process with ID = 1.\n* This init process creates all the process required to run Linux on boot up. Init process is the parent of all processes.\n* init process works only in kernel mode.\n* Some other process that execute only in kernel mode include dispatcher etc.\n* States\n    * ![](/assets/images//assets/images/2021-09-06-08-47-29.png)\n    * Fork is the system call used to create new process.\n    * Two extra states\n    * Blocking state is called sleep state.\n    * Zombie state means that process is executed but some imformation realted to data structure and all is still saved for accounting purposes.\n    * Here running state is divided into two parts viz user running state and kernel running state.\n    * At a time, a process can be in either user running state or kernel running state but **not both.**\n    * Preempted is almost similar to ready to run in memory state. In fact they are managed by a common combined queue.\n* UNIX Process Image\n    * A process in UNIX is a set of DS that provide the OS with all the information necessary to manage and dispatch processes.\n    * Process image in UNIX can be categorized as follows\n        * User-Level Context\n            * Process text - executable machine instructions for program\n            * Process data - data used by the process\n            * User stack - conatins arguments, local variabels, pointers for executing user mode\n            * Shared memory - memory shared with other processes, used for innterprocess communication.\n        * Register Context\n            * Program counter - address of next instruction to be executed\n            * Processor state register - has different flag\n            * stack pointer - points to top of kernel or user stackdepending on mode of execution.\n            * General purposee registers - hardware dependent\n        * System-Level Context\n            * Process table entry - defines state of a process - STATIC\n                * contains data of a process that must be always accessible to kernel\n            * U area - PCB is divided in 3 parts - 3rd - any specific info of a process in U area is only accisible when that process is in running state. - DYNAMIC\n            * per process region table - STATIC \n            * kernel stack - maintaining system level context - DYNAMIC\n            * Most of the information regarding PCB is maintained in process table and they **must be accessible to kernel.**\n            * U Area - Most of the process control information is present in U area. This is also a part of PCB. However, majority of information related to PCB is present in Process table.\n            * Information in U area is accessible to a process only if it is in running state.\n            * 1st and 3rd are static DS means they will not change during the life of a process.\n            * 2 - process control info. nd and 4th are dynamic data structure and will change according to various states of the process.\n* Process Creation in UNIX\n    * fork() is used to create new processes.\n    * ![](/assets/images//assets/images/2021-09-09-11-26-30.png)\n    ![](/assets/images//assets/images/2021-09-09-11-27-38.png)\n    * If returned value is 0, it means it is child process and vice versa.\n    * Once child is created, then it depends on the situation which one will execute.\n            \n## Extra Points\n> What is in process table?\n* ![](/assets/images//assets/images/2021-09-09-11-22-44.png)\n\n> What is in U area?\n* ![](/assets/images//assets/images/2021-09-09-11-23-18.png)","url":"https://aneri12345.github.io/Personal-Log/notes\\275oHnSOurASwRFVYefgE.html","relUrl":"notes\\275oHnSOurASwRFVYefgE.html"},{"doc":"Lec 1","title":"Lec 1","hpath":"Courses.Sem-5.OS.Notes.Lec 5","content":"\n\n## Suspended Process (5-state)\n* It is possible that at one point _all the processes are waiting_ for I/O and processor will remain idle.\n* Issues to address\n    * Processor could be idle most of the time.\n* Solution\n    * **Swap these processes to disk to free RAM and execute some new processes**.\n* Blocked state, thus, becomes suspend state when swapped to disk.\n* Now 5-state gets converted to 6-state model\n\n## 6-state model\n* ![](2021-09-11-16-27-42.png)\n* Notice that blocked processes are transferred to suspended processes BUT suspened processes are **directly** transfered to ready state.\n* OS now has two ways to bring process in main memory\n    * Admit new processes\n    * Activate previously suspended processes\n* Subsets of suspend state\n    * Blocked/Suspend: Process in secondary memory and awaiting an event.\n    * Ready/Suspend: In secondary mem but available for execution as soon as brought in main memory\n\n## 7-state model\n* ![](2021-09-11-16-36-47.png)\n* If memory is not available, new process can be admitted into ready/suspended memory\n* Newly created process will remain in ready/suspend state until there is memory avaible to move it to ready state.\n* Eg.

Here we assume that there is always a single processor system.\r\n* Allocate resources to processes and protect them from each other especially in the case where both processes are using same files, to avoid any clashes.\r\n* Enable process to share and exchange information. Eg. Parent and Child processes.\r\n* Enable synchronization among processes.\r\n\r\n## What is a Process?\r\n* Program in execution.\r\n* Instance of program running\r\n* Entity that can be assigned to and executed on a processor\r\n* **Unit of activity characterized by the execution of a sequence of instructions, a current state and an associated set of resources**\r\n* Process Elements\r\n    * Program code (generally shared)\r\n    * Set of data\r\n    * Attributes that describes the state\r\n    \r\n## Attributes - maintained in PCB\r\n* Indentifier - Unique ID of each process\r\n* State - Current situation of the process (Either running or not running)\r\n* Priority - Self explanatory\r\n* Program Counter - Keeps information about next process to be executed\r\n* Memory pointers - Pointers to program code and data to be processed. Along with this, it also includes shared memory blocks.\r\n* Context data\r\n* I/O status information - Eg. List of files in use by the process etc.\r\n* Accounting information - Eg. Time limits, clocks used etc.\r\n\r\n> _In short the attributes can be called as meta-data_ (things apart from the program and data, these are the things which manage and drive the process).\r\n\r\n## Process Control Block (PCB)\r\n* All the attributes discussed above are maintained in this block.\r\n* Basically, it is a type of data structure.\r\n\r\n> **Thus, process is a combination of program code, associated data and PCB**\r\n\r\n## Running on single resource\r\n* To manage multiple processes on a single resources then scheduling comes to the picture.\r\n* Thus, you allocate certain span of time to each process and once it gets finished, immediately another process starts.\r\n* It gives an appearance that every process runs at the same time because the total time taken by all the process combined is really small.\r\n* **Trace - List of instructions that are executed by a process.**\r\n* **Dispatcher - Program that switches the processor from one process to another.** It is a type of short term scheduler.\r\n\r\n## Execution of Processes by Processor\r\n* Suppose that there are some processes which have a lot of instructions to execute. This might take time which is greater than the allocated one.\r\n* So in the middle of the execution of a process, dispatcher stops the execution and decides which process should go next.\r\n* Once decided, either execution of new process starts or execution of old process continues.\r\n* Then, suppose there is an I/O request. Since this is a slow operation, the dispatcher will allow another process to run on the processor.\r\n* This goes on and on untill all the processes are executed.\r\n\r\n> The above method is from **processor POV** and is called **interleaving of processes** and the OS manages this through **dispatcher**. From **process POV**, the process gets executed sequencially.\r\n\r\n## Process States\r\n* Two states\r\n    * Running\r\n    * Not running\r\n* Transition from **not running** to **running** state is called **dispatch** and is called **pause** for the opposite scenario.\r\n* There can be at most only one process in running state at a given instance of time.\r\n* There are 'n' number of processes in the non-running state.\r\n* Thus, to manage all these processes, we need **queue** as the data structure.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n* The below picture lists conditions under which a process can be created or terminated.\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-23-18-55.png)\r\n* Process spawning means event where a process creates a new process.\r\n\r\n## 5-State Process Model\r\n* Conditions when the process which is running will pause and enter in the queue:\r\n    * Time slot alloted to the process is over.\r\n    * Made some I/O request which may take time.\r\n* Now, dispatcher needs to identify which processes are ready to be executed and then_ dispatch it from the middle of the queue._ This process is **time consuming and complex.**\r\n* **Solution:**  OS must maintain multiple queues. Since there are two types of processes\r\n    * Waiting - one who did not terminate but their allocated time got over and others who are waiting for I/O or other resouces.\r\n    * Others that are ready to be dispatched and timeout ones (alloted time is over).\r\n*  _**This, in turn is the 5-state process model.**_\r\n* Total states in this model\r\n    1. New - Process that has just been created but not admitted to the pool of the ready state processes.\r\n        * **Not loaded in main memory but is created.**\r\n        * This means that PCB for that process has been created but its corresponding data and program has not been loaded/created in the main memory.\r\n    2. Ready - DS: queue\r\n    3. Blocked/Waiting - DS: queue\r\n    4. Running \r\n    5.

This immense heating causing chemically binded water to detach from the clay making it very hard.\n* **Note that the temperature when firing the clay should be raised slowly and not drastically.**\n* This is because clay is porous and when firing, chemically bonded water will try to escape. Now, if suddenly the temperature is raised then the chemically bonded water will not escape suddenly.\n* Instead, the silica fuses into one another trapping the chemically bonded water.\n* Now, at high temperatures, these chemically bonded water turns into steam creating air bubbles.\n* As a result, the clay will disintegrate immediately. Same applies for cooling too. You have to cool the clay very slowly.\n\n## Colors of material at different temperature\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-22-04-32.png)\n\n## Quartz Inversion Temperature\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-22-06-48.png)\n* Quartz is silicon dioxide (SiO2) and has a trigonal crystalline structure called as alpha-quartz.\n* At 573 degrees it gets converted into beta-quartz which is hexagonal in shape.\n* So now, it holds clay at 6 points unlike earlier where it holded clay at only 3 points.\n* Now, because of this beta-quartz, the properties of silica change and thus, becomes impervious to water damage.\n* Now, if we cool the clay as soon as it reached 573 degrees, only some part of clay will get converted and majority will disintegrate as soon as it comes in contact of water.\n* Therfore, it is of vital importance that we keep the clay at least equal to 573 degrees for about 2-3 hrs. It depends on how big is the pot.\n* Finally, after quartz inversion takes place, clay turns into ceramics.\n\n## Sintering\n* This is the next phase of clay firing starting at 900 degrees.\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-22-07-10.png)\n* **After this phase, the water will be retained because of fusion of clay particles.**\n* Pores get removed due to exertion of pressure on each silica particle.\n* This process is called **solid phase sintering.**\n\n## Vitrification\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-22-07-31.png)\n* After solid phase sintering, there might be some pores that are still left which may allow water to pass.\n* Thus, this next phase is crucial to cover all the pores.\n* In order to lower the melting point of silica, flux is added.\n* Flux is **glassy** in nature. In fact, vitri means glass case.\n* Flux are oxides of metals like calcium, sodian, magnesium, lead, potassion, manganese etc.\n* Now, these oxides (in power form) melt at 1600 degrees and form a liquid.\n* This liquid flows into the pores and solidifies there making the clay fully impervious.\n* This process is called **liquid phase sintering.**\n* **Here, note that silica particles are not melting. It is the flux that is melting.**\n\n## Glazing\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-22-08-03.png)\n* It beautifies clay by giving it a feel of glass.\n* **Vitreous means glassy.**\n\n## Summary of stages of clay\n* Quartz inversion\n* Solid phase sintering\n* Liquid phase sintering (vitrification).\n* This turns clay to ceramics.\n* Glaze\n\n## Extra Points\n* Melting point of silica = 2000 degress.\n\n---\n\n## Wood\n* This is an organic material and is found in nature.\n* Made from cellulose and bio-organisms can decay these materials.\n* Carving would be easier on wood rather than that on stone because wood is way more softer than stone.\n* Wood is higly porous.\n\n## Surfaces of wood\n* Inlay\n    * Insertion of stone by making a fine cut in the wood.\n* Paint\n* Varnish\n* Gilded\n    * Gold leaf is applied with plaster like substance (to provide adhesiveness to gold leaf) to give wood a appearance of metal.\n* Lacquer\n    * Dip the material in lac which develop aesthetic cracks.\n\n## Important timbers\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-01.png)\n\n## Types of wood\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-47.png)\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-11-49.png)\n\n## Components of wood\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-12-21.png)\n* If all the water is lost from the wood, then the wood would shrink and vice versa.\n* The exansion and contraction takes place in wood to a great extent. This is because wood is made of cellulose.\n* This changes the shape of wood and this process if called warping of wood.\n* Polysaccharides gives wood its woody appearance. They are just mixture of sugar.\n* Hemicellulose is branched chain and cellulose is composed of mixture of unbranched chain. Former is a mixture of sugar whereas latter is the mixture of glucose.\n* Lignin acts as a binding agent and gives wood its hardness and softness. This means that if lignin is less than bonding is less and vice versa.\n* **Phenol is aromatic alcohol.**","url":"https://aneri12345.github.io/Personal-Log/notes\\4yCdo5gyRPwefXXyuaBgC.html","relUrl":"notes\\4yCdo5gyRPwefXXyuaBgC.html"},{"doc":"Lec 6","title":"Lec 6","hpath":"Courses.Sem-5.HRT.Notes.Lec 6","content":"\n\n# Steel and Ceramics\n\n## Stainless Steel\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-17-50-45.png)\n* Chromium oxide layer is impervious layer.

Thus, we can say that the non-metallic quality of metal increases.\n* **Magnetic effect** is used to detect how much **core metal** is left and how much **rust** is formed.\n\n## Electrochemical Series\n* Li, K, Ca, Na, Mg, Al, Zn, Fe, Sn, Pb, H, Cu, Hg, Ag, Au\n* The metals here are placed according to their decreasing reactivity. Hence, going down the electrochemical series, the reactivity will decrease.\n* Thus, gold is the least reactive metal and hence it is sometimes also called as noble metal.\n* It basically does not react with anything. It only dissolves in aqua regia.\n> Pure copper does not rust/corrode easily and hence they are used for electrical installations. Another reason for that use is that it is an excellent conductor of electrivity.\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-09-00-03.png)\n* Oxidation \n    * When a metal looses electron. \n    * The power to loose electron is called oxidation potential.\n    * Lesser reactive metals have lower oxidation potential than more reactive metals.\n* Reduction\n    * When a metal gains electron.\n    * The power to gain electron is called reduction potential.\n    * Lesser reactive metals have higher reduction potential than more reactive metals.\n* Reducing agent is a more reactive metal that displaces a metal from its sulfate state and vice versa.\n* In metallic terms, **_oxidation is also called corrosion_**.\n* Rust - Iron Oxide\n\n## Galvanic Cell\n* Also known as Voltaic cell or Daniel cell or Electrochemical cell\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-10-27-54.png)\n* Electrode is a solid electrical conductor that carries a current. Two types include anode and cathode.\n* Zinc acts as anode and copper acts as cathode.\n* Electrolyte (Salt Bridge) is of vital importance as it completes the circuit for current to flow.\n* Now once the circuit is complete and current starts flowing, zinc begins to loose electrons.\n* This is because, copper has more reducing potential and as a result has a greater power to pull the electrons.\n* So in time, Zinc gets converted to zinc sulfate and copper sulfate gets converted to pure copper.\n* **To summarize, less reactive metal will get deposited and more reactive metal will get used up during electrolisis.**\n* Thus, to preserve a less reactive metal, just bring a more reactive metal in contact with the less reactive metal. This process is called anodic preferential corrosion or anodic sacrificial protection.\n* Similarly, if a more reactive metal is to be protected than we coat that metal with a less reactive metal and this process is called cathodic protection. (Used mainly for protecting silver by coating gold on it).\n\n## Tarnising of silver\n* Silver is almost a noble metal and hence it is very difficult for it to corrode.\n* Tarnish color is black.\n* There is NO formation of oxygen\n* Oxygen can not harm silver but sulfur can. \n![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-10-55-23.png) \n* Only on the surface.\n* We preserve tarnished silver to preserve silver and it also represent age and authenticity in silver artifacts.\n* **Patina** is just a layer and surface discoloration. It is a surface phenomena.\n* Silver sulfide layer is called as **noble patina** because it is non reactive.\n\n> Oxide layer on broze is blackish in color or called as blackish patina.\n\n> Cuprous oxide layer is brownish in color and later it will change to cupric oxide which is more stable and is blackish in color.\n\n## Types of oxide\n* Unstable metal oxide - Gold, Silver and Platinum\n* Stable metal oxide - Copper, Tin and Lead\n* Volatile metal oxide - Molebdenum\n* Porous metal oxide - Sodium, Potassium, Manganese and iron.","url":"https://aneri12345.github.io/Personal-Log/notes\\HsP5QBlw4t05MqvQPn5Bo.html","relUrl":"notes\\HsP5QBlw4t05MqvQPn5Bo.html"},{"doc":"Lec 3","title":"Lec 3","hpath":"Courses.Sem-5.HRT.Notes.Lec 3","content":"\n\n# Hardness of Stones and Introduction to metals\n\n## Mohs Hardness Scale\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-17-52-50.png)\n* Gypsum\n    * Used as one of the raw components of cement and its called calcium sulphate.\n    * It is really soft.\n* Calcite\n    * Chief component of limestone and marble.\n    * It is called Calcium Carbonate\n    * MONOMINERALIC - marble, calcite\n* Quartz\n    * It is very hard.\n    * Chief element in sandstone\n    * Used in sandstone and granite\n    * Hence, these materials are also hard.\n    * It is called silicon dioxide.\n    * Harder than Gypsum and Calcite as evident from the above figure.\n    * This means that if **iron content** is more, then it **gives red** color and if **clay content** is more, then it **gives yellow** color.\n    * The red color of the red fort is red because of ferruginous sandstone. This iron gets rusted and gives red color.\n    * The yellow colored sandstone is called as argilesious sandstone.\n\n## Use of stones in monuments\n* Humanyun's Tomb, Delhi\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-18-07-26.png)\n    * Made using sandstone (red colored) and marble (white colored).\n* Taj Mahal, Agra\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-18-07-01.png)\n    * Again made using sandstone (main platform) and brick and marble (outer/external padding).\n    * Iron slabs/rod are used to padd marble and hence we can see some rusting where iron is inserted.\n\n* **Note: Sandstone is always at base and marble is at top. Marble is a porous stone.**\n\n    > Why is it not the reverse?\n    * This is because, sandstone is a stronger than marble and hence has the capacity to hold the weight of marble.\n* Biwi ka maqbara, Aurangabad\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-18-09-10.png)\n    * Made using a very fine and polished limestone and only 25% marble is used.\n* Granitie got lot of time to cool  so everywhere uniform\nBasalt: has a vein, different rate of solidification for each part\n## Extra Points\n* Average temperature of venus is 470 degrees.\n* Mars surface temperature is -53 degrees.\n* Earth's surface temperature earlier was 290 degrees and nowadays it is 15 degrees.\n    > What was the climatic condition that led it to cool down?\n    * It was covered with Carbon Dioxide, but during formation of limestone, more than 80% of the gas was consumed and thus, the earth's surface temperature cooled.  CaO + CO2 -> CaCO3\n* During the production of cement, we are reversing the formation of limestone.\n* Thus, we are releasing a lot of carbon dioxide.\n* Stones used in formation of qutub minar are marble, sandstone and **quartzite.**\n* Based on quartizite, Alai Minar in Delhi was made. Originally, it was supposed to be a replica of Qutub Minar with double height, but could not be completed.\n* Kailashnath Temple, Ellora is made using Basalt which is extrunious igneous rock formed by volcanic rocks.\n* Brihadishwar Temple, Tanjavur is made using granite.\n* **Anything that has to migrate from one surface to other surface, the other surface must be more porous compared to the first one.**\n\n# Metals\n* Most of the metals are subject to corrosion due to atmospheric moisture.\n* Metals used in heritage\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-07-57-58.png)\n    * These metals are placed in the order of their corrsion resistance and hardness.\n* Alloys used in heritage\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-08-14-17.png)\n    * First coin was prepared from **electrum**. It is also called green gold if available naturally, but artificially made electrum is called white gold because some amount of palladium.\n    * **Brass** will corrode first as compared to bronze because it has amounts of zinc.\n    * **Broze** is made from 90% copper and 10% tin. Similar is the case for brass but with its respective metals.\n    * **Pewter** will appear like silver, but that silvery finish is mainly due to tin and little bit of silver. Tin is chief component, then Copper, steel etc.\n\n## Extra Points\n* Ore is the most stable state of a metal. We provide energy to make it pure, which is an active form of the metal.\n* Metal will always want to go back to its stable state.\n* Iron is more abundant than copper in earth's crust.\n* But still copper age was before iron.\n* This is because, melting point of iron is much more than that of copper and hence, it was difficult to make iron objects.\n* Gold only dissolves in aqua regia only.\n* Some metal occur in natural form and other in ore form.\n* Stable state of any metal is its rust form and the most active when it is extracted from ore.\n* This active state is achieved by supplying energy to extract it from its ore.","url":"https://aneri12345.github.io/Personal-Log/notes\\KM4Zb6NjicqnyTEhrS3T6.html","relUrl":"notes\\KM4Zb6NjicqnyTEhrS3T6.html"},{"doc":"Lec 2","title":"Lec 2","hpath":"Courses.Sem-5.HRT.Notes.Lec 2","content":"\n## 2 types of heritage\n1.
