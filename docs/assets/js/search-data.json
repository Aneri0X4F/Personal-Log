Here we assume that there is always a single processor system.\r\n* Allocate resources to processes and protect them from each other.\r\n* Enable process to share and exchange information. Eg. Parent and Child processes.\r\n* Enable synchronization among processes.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n* Program in execution.\r\n* Instance of program running\r\n* Entity that can be assigned to and executed on a processor\r\n* **Unit of activity defined by program, its states and its associated resources.**\r\n* Process Elements\r\n    * Program code (generally shared)\r\n    * Set of data\r\n    * Attributes that describes the state\r\n    \r\n## Attributes\r\n* Indentifier - Unique ID of each process\r\n* State - Current situation of the process (Either running or not running)\r\n* Priority - Self explanatory\r\n* Program Counter - Keeps information about next process to be executed\r\n* Memory pointers - Pointers to program code and data to be processed. Along with this, it also includes shared memory blocks.\r\n* Context data\r\n* I/O status information - Eg. List of files in use by the process etc.\r\n* Accounting information - Eg. Time limits, clocks used etc.\r\n\r\n> In short the attributes can be called as meta-data.\r\n\r\n## Process Control Block (PCB)\r\n* All the attributes discussed above are part of this block.\r\n* Basically, it is a type of data structure.\r\n\r\n> **Thus, process is a combination of program code, associated data and PCB**\r\n\r\n## Running on single resource\r\n* To manage multiple processes on a single resources then scheduling comes to the picture.\r\n* Thus, you allocate certain span of time to each process and once it gets finished, immediately another process starts.\r\n* It gives an appearance that every process runs at the same time because the total time taken by all the process combined is really small.\r\n* **Trace - List of instructions that are executed by a process.**\r\n* **Dispatcher - Program that switches the processor from one process to another.** It is a type of short term scheduler.\r\n\r\n## Execution of Processes by Processor\r\n* Suppose that there are some processes which have a lot of instructions to execute. This might take time which is greater than the allocated one.\r\n* So in the middle of the execution of a process, dispatcher stops the execution and decides which process should go next.\r\n* Once decided, either execution of new process starts or execution of old process continues.\r\n* Then, suppose there is an I/O request. Since this is a slow operation, the dispatcher will allow another process to run on the processor.\r\n* This goes on and on untill all the processes are executed.\r\n\r\n> The above method is from **processor POV** and is called **interleaving of processes** and the OS manages this through **dispatcher**. From **process POV**, the process gets executed sequencially.\r\n\r\n## Process States\r\n* Two states\r\n    * Running\r\n    * Not running\r\n* Transition from **not running** to **running** state is called **dispatch** and is called **pause** for the opposite scenario.\r\n* There can be at most only one process in running state at a given instance of time.\r\n* There are 'n' number of processes in the non-running state.\r\n* Thus, to manage all these processes, we need **queue** as the data structure.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n* The below picture lists conditions under which a process can be created or terminated.\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-16-50.png)\r\n\r\n* Process spawning means event where a process creates a new process.\r\n\r\n## 5-State Process Model\r\n* Conditions when the process which is running will pause and enter in the queue:\r\n    * Time slot alloted to the process is over.\r\n    * Made some I/O request which may take time.\r\n* Now, dispatcher needs to identify which processes are ready to be executed and then dispatch it from the middle of the queue.\r\n* This process is time consuming and complex.\r\n* To resolve this, OS must maintain multiple queues. Since there are two types of processes, one who did not terminate but their allocated time got over and others who are waiting for I/O or other resouces.\r\n* This, in turn is the 5-state process model.\r\n* Total states in this model\r\n    * New - Process that has just been created but not admitted to the pool of the ready state processes.\r\n        * **Not loaded in main memory but is created.**\r\n        * This means that PCB for that process has been created but its corresponding data and program has not been loaded/created in the main memory.\r\n    * Ready\r\n    * Blocked/Waiting\r\n    * Running\r\n    * Exit (Earlier it was not a state but now it is) - Process which has been released from the pool of processes.\r\n        * However, there is some part of PCB left in main memory for accounting.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-32-07.png)\r\n\r\n## State Transitions\r\n\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-36-29.png)\r\n\r\n* Ready and Blocked process can enter directly to exit state when its parent process has terminated or the process is terminated by the OS.\r\n* When process spawning occurs, then child process is created in the new state.\r\n* Hang state is equivalent to blocked/waiting state.\r\n\r\n## Multiple Blocked Queue\r\n* Suppose there are 10 processes which are in blocked queue waiting for HDD to get accesible and there are 90 processes that are in hang mode.\r\n* Now once HDD is ready to be accessed, OS will have to search this blocked queue and move all these processes to ready state.\r\n* This is again time consuming and complex. Hence multiple blocked queue model emerged.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-48-46.png)","url":"https://aneri12345.github.io/Personal-Log/notes\\tFy23OlAvEHgWWoRF2db5.html","relUrl":"notes\\tFy23OlAvEHgWWoRF2db5.html"},{"doc":"MSE","title":"MSE","hpath":"Courses.Sem-5.MSE","content":"\n","url":"https://aneri12345.github.io/Personal-Log/notes\\RENT41HZ7tBYu7kQlwqsP.html","relUrl":"notes\\RENT41HZ7tBYu7kQlwqsP.html"},{"doc":"IDTB","title":"IDTB","hpath":"Courses.Sem-5.IDTB","content":"\n","url":"https://aneri12345.github.io/Personal-Log/notes\\RekrWYfJI7kuXr4zvKuNt.html","relUrl":"notes\\RekrWYfJI7kuXr4zvKuNt.html"},{"doc":"Notes1","title":"Notes1","hpath":"Courses.Sem-5.IDTB.Notes","content":"\n## Psycology\n* The science of behaviour and mind \n* Application of science to solve human problems\n* Feelings - unobservable | Behaviour - observable actions\n* Science is gaining knowledge by observation and experimentation\n## Structuralism\n* Break down into its constituent elements (sensation/emotions/feelings)\n* Method: Introspection\n* What questions: \"What were you feeling\"\n* **Problems**  \n    * Got all elements but cannot comphrehend well about the function.\n## Functionalist\n* mind and behaviour is adaptive(perp for exam/ playing..)\n* How learning/ memory happens\n* Why questions\n* **Problems**  \n    * No scientific method to determine/ observe mind\n## Behaviorism\n* Observe - Experiment - Analyse\n* Should study behaviour instead of mind\n* 3 beliefs of behaviouralist\n    * Complex behavious are orn from the pre elementry knwledge\n    * Focus on learnd behviour not inbuilt \n    * humans and animals are same\n* **Problems**\n    * Focuses onnly on behaviour, whats inside mind is missed out \n## Gestalt psycologist \n* Mind works as whole and not in parts\n* Mind triesto find patterns\n![](2021-09-05-00-31-03.png)\n## Organisational Behaviour Model\n* Framework: Input, Process, Output\n* EG:  \n    * **Individual level:** Humans are the inputs, feelings/emotions are process, output is our work\n    * **Group Level:** coordination etc\n    * **Organisation level:** culture, structure\n    ![](2021-09-05-11-51-39.png)\n    ![](2021-09-05-11-54-58.png)\n## Learning\nRelatively permenant change in ones behaviour due to an experience(affecting ones sensory systems)\n## Classical conditioning\n* Conditioned Stimulus - condition that accompanies natural stimulus\n* Unonditioned Stimulus - natural event\n* Conditioned Response - behaviour for conditioned stimulus\n* Unconditioned Response - how do we react naturally\n## Operant Conditioning\n* Behvaiour is function of consequences\n## Social Learning Theory\n* Individuals learn by observing others and gaining experiencing   \n* **Vicarious reinforceents** - Not necessary to behave in perticular manner to know output, you can observe and and reinforce some actions\n* People respond on how they percieve and define consequences NOT to the objective consequences. **_Can be different_**\n## Johari window\n![](2021-09-06-08-29-17.png)\n![](2021-09-06-08-29-42.png)\n![](2021-09-06-08-30-03.png)\n![](2021-09-06-08-30-19.png)\n## Piaget's Theory\n* Children learn by exploring and playing","url":"https://aneri12345.github.io/Personal-Log/notes\\w51gdQ0gRcuJd6eSUMSdf.html","relUrl":"notes\\w51gdQ0gRcuJd6eSUMSdf.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://aneri12345.github.io/Personal-Log/notes\\changelog.html","relUrl":"notes\\changelog.html"}]
