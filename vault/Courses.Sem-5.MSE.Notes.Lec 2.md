* Also gather more information on these topics from the recomended book for quizes!
## Ceramics
* compound of metals and non metals
* hard and brittle 
* protects from high temp (space shuttle)
* Found in bone and teeth
* inorganic, non metallic 
* composed of more than 1 elements
* Eg: clay, glass Used in: sensors, credit cards
## Biomaterials
* several uses: tooth fixing, artificial hand
## Semiconductors
* between conductor and insulators
## Composite material
* Electronic material benifits: Mixture of polymer and nano partcles
* reduces weight and cost of object  
## Atomc structure and bonding in materials
*  Difference in properties due to diff. **interatomic bonding**. Eg: Graphite, Diamond

## **Number density**

Ionization potential | Electron Affinity |
-|-
 IP: energy required to pull out a valance electron. | EA: energy gained by putting an electron in.
 It is **always positive**|  It is **Always Negetive**

## Electro negetivity
Measure of how likely an atom will takeup or give up an electron.
