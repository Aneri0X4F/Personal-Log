# Materials
* Metals
* Ceramics
* Polymers
* Semiconductors
* Composites
* Biomaterials

* Also gather more information on these topics from the recomended book for quizes!
## Ceramics
* compound of metals and non metals
* hard and brittle 
* protects from high temp (space shuttle)
* Found in bone and teeth
* inorganic, non metallic 
* composed of more than 1 elements
* Eg: clay, glass Used in: sensors, credit cards
## Biomaterials
* several uses: tooth fixing, artificial hand
## Semiconductors
* between conductor and insulators
## Composite material
* Electronic material benifits: Mixture of polymer and nano partcles
* reduces weight and cost of object  
## Atomc structure and bonding in materials
*  Difference in properties due to diff. **interatomic bonding**. Eg: Graphite, Diamond

## **Number density**

Ionization potential | Electron Affinity |
-|-
 IP: energy required to pull out a valance electron. | EA: energy gained by putting an electron in.
 It is **always positive**|  It is **Always Negetive**

## Electro negetivity
Measure of how likely an atom will takeup or give up an electron.

# Bonding
![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-02-35.png)
* ## Primary Bonding
    * **Ionic bond**: Na+Cl-
        * Non directional, since cation(+) not only atracted by near ions but even farther ones
        ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-14-51-37.png)
    * **Covalent Bond**: electrons shared between atoms
        * Directional Bonding
    * **Metallic**: Electrostatic force between positive ions and deloclozed outer ions.
        * Weaker than covalent and ionic bond
### _More difference in electronegetivity between A and B, more Ionic bond, else covalent bond_


* ## Secondary Bond
    * No transfer of electrons, share outer electron
    * Interaction between dipoles
    * Eg: H2, H2O, CH4
* ## Vander Waals Bonding

## Determine structure of a crystal 
* Using **X-Ray difractogram**
