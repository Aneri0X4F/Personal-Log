## 2 types of heritage
1. Tangible Heritage - Touchable
    * Eg: Music, Dance
2. Intangible Heritage - Cannot be touched
    * Eg: monuments

# Stones
* For sculptures, we need hard stones (not too hard not too soft)
* To preserve any sculpture, we need to know
    * Properties
    * Material
    * Formation of it
> Oil transfers from less porous to high porous material


## What are rocks?
* Rock VS Stone
    * Outer layer of earth is Rock. The detached part from rock is stone.
* Rocks are combination of minerals bonded together in some way
    * **Monominerallic** - 1 mineral
    * **Pollymineralic** - more than 1 mineral
* Types of rocks
    1. **Igneous** - Made from lava cooling 
        * on the surface - **_exclusive igneous rock_**
            * Cool quickly(low temp and pressure), it is _fine grained_ 
            * Formed from lava
            * Large crystal size
            * lacks crystal growth
            * More compact, No time for it to expand while formation
            * It can or cannot have pores 
                1. Eg: Pumice rock, basalt (Too many pores, no time so air within couldnt escape) 
                2. Eg. Obsdian rock 
        * in the core of earth - **_intrusive igneous rock_**
            * Since they cool slowly, it is _coarse grained_ 
            * Formed from magma
            * Small orno crystal
        > Molten material is called **Magma**
        * **Granite** 
            * intrusive
            * Most abundant igneous rock
            * Conatins - feldspar, quartz#(silicon-dioxide), mica, hornblende
            > Pure quartz is transperent | impure hascolor and opacity
        * Felsic 
            * (it felt sick) Light in color
            * Low density
            * Contains Al, Si
        * Mafic
            * Dark colored
            * High density
            * Rick in iron
        * Coarse grained - longer to cool, larger visible
        * Fine grained - cools quickly, smaller
        * Glassy texture - cools **quickest**, no mineral crystal
        * Vesicular - gas pockets
       
    2. **Metamorphic** (is a child, there HAS to be a parent rock)
        * Metamorphosis of Prexisting rock - subjected to high temp and pressure
        * Mechanically formed
        * Types - regional and contact etamorphic rock

    3. **Sedimentory**
        * wheathring of prev formed rocks - layer by layer depoition - forms sedimentry rock
        * Usually formed in watery env
        * Often layered
        >_ ONLY ROCKS THAT CONTAINs FOSSILS_
        * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-17-26-39.png)
        * Compaction and Cementation - **lithification**
        * Eg: _Sandstone, Limestone(chuna)_, Rocksalt(aka evaporites), iron ore, coal
