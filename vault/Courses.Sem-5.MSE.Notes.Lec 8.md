## Viva questions
1. line edge deffect
2. burger defect
3. poss to have any single or can have both defect
4. what is stacking fault
5. BCC atoms, packing
6. ACCURACY IN SPEAKING
7. Technicality
8. Crystal - Geometrical arrangement of atoms is crystal.
* An ideal crystal is a perfect arrangement where each atom has
9. Lattice- A geometrical arrangement of points or objects over an area or space.
10. grain defect
11. XRD formula - define each: n

 identical srroundngs.
* Real crystals are finite in size.
* Surface atoms are imperfect since they are open from one side.
* **Defect** - deviation from perfect periodic array of atomic arrangement.
*  Carbon in iron makes **steel**
* Boron in Silicon canges its electrical properties.
* **Sterling silver** - 92.5% Silver 7.5% Copper (Stronger than normal steel)
## Defects
1. **0D - Point defects**
* Vacancy Defect
    * Crystallization
    * Growth process - when we grow crystal, nucleatio   forms then forms crystal, if more than 1 nuclii, poy crystal. During this process, vacancies arise
    * Temperature - Jump fro lower to higher energy state
    * Number of vacancies:

     ![](/assets/images/2021-09-18-17-53-18.png)
* Self-Interstitials
    * NOT SUBSTITUTIONAL
    * Here place taken between 2 atoms y extra atoms
* Substitution
    * No difference in taomic radii not more than 15%
    * Similar atomic structure
    * Electonegetivity difference not more
* Impurity Defect
* Frankel Defect
    * ion is displaced from a regular site to an interstitial site.
    * Cations are smaller so higher chance to dislocate into the void space
    * Doesnot change overall neutrality of the crystal.
* Schottky Defect
    * One pair of positive and negetive ion is missing from ionic crystal. And placing both of them in the external surface
    * how and WHY it occurs: 
        * To maintain charge neutrality
        ![](/assets/images/2021-09-18-18-05-42.png)
    * Common in alkali hallides
* Electrical Defects
    * error in charge distribution in solids 
    * Imbalace in stoichiometry of charges
2. **1D - Line defect**
* Dislocation - edge, screw, mixed
    * Slip between crystal planes
    * This produces permenant **plastic deformation**
    * **Edge dislocation** - in crystal, atoms are arranged in both bertical and horizontal planes parallel to the side faces.
    * if one of these do not extend till full length between the ends, its edge dislocation.
    * In the vacant place, the atoms are 
    squezed.
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-18-19-00-44.png)
    * measured by Burger vector
    * **Screw Dislocation** 
        * dislocation in 2 diff planes parallel
        * Burgers vector is parallel to dislocation line
    * Burger vector 
        * direction + magnitude
        * 
    * A crystal can have both Edge and screw defect. **Mixed dislocations**
* Disclination
* Dispiration
3. 2D - Surface Defact
* Surface
    * Atoms quiet out 
* Interphase boundary
* Grain Boundary
* Twin Boundary
* Stacking Faults
* Antiphase boundaries
