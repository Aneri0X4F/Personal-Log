## Transducer 
* Convets one form of signal to another
* **Sensors** - non electrical to electrical signal convertor
    * Eg - thermocouple, microphone
* **Acturator** - converts electrical to non electrical
    * Eg - Hearer, speaker

* For y, input - analog; output - digital
* y1 = f(x)
*  Considering possibility that function can be incorrect, we can use "look up table".
* A-D converter has 2 signals to undertake conversion - start pulse/ start conversion and end of conversion(EOC )
* After EOC is done, then read values of y1
