## Material Science and Engineering
* Study of physical and chemical properties of any material or products.
* Engineering: The product
* General examples:
    * Semi-conducting materials- OLED (Organic LED- phones), Solar Cell

# Extra

* Magnitude of charge on Electrons and protons: 1.6 * 10^-19 C
* Atomic number(Z): Number of protons
* Atomic mass: M(elec) + M(protons)
    * Isotopes: Same elements with diff. atomic mass
    * "amu" is the unit for atomic weight (weighted average of the atomic masses of the atomâ€™s naturally occurring isotopes
    )
    * Atomic weight = molecular weight
    * 1 mole = 6.023 * 10^23 atoms
    * 1amu/ atom = 1g/mol
## Quantum Mechanics: 
Set of principles and laws that
govern systems of atomic and subatomic entities.

*  Bohr model represents an early attempt to describe electrons in
atoms, in terms of both position (electron orbitals) and energy (quantized energy
levels).
* Wave-mechanical model: in which the electron is
considered to exhibit both wave-like and particle-like characteristics.
* Principle quantum numbers: K, L, M, N, O
* Shape of electron subshell: s, p, d, f

## Pauli exclusion principle
* Each electron state can hold no more than two
electrons, which must have opposite spins. 
* Thus, s, p, d, and f subshells may each accommodate, respectively, a total of 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons.
* Net force between 2 atoms :
Fn = Fa(Attraction) + Fr(repulsion)
