## FCC vs Hexagonal packing: 
* FCC - abcabc | 74% PD
* HCP - ababab | 74% PD 
## Density computation

## Why are planes in a lattice important?
1. Determining crystal structure
    * Diffraction methods measure distance between parallel lattice planes of atoms to determine the lattice parameters
2. Plastic Deformation
    * Plastic deformation in metals occur by slip od atoms past each other. This slip tends to occur preferentially along specific crystal-dependent planes.
3. Transport properties
    * Certain atomic structures transport heat and electrons higher in specific planes than others.

    * **Miller indices** 
        * St of numbers used to represent a crystal pane.
##  X-Ray diffraction
* n(lamda) = 2dsin(tehta)
* n is order of reflection (assume 1)
d = a/sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

* For any materia, if **d value and intensit** is mentioned then any material used will be ok.
