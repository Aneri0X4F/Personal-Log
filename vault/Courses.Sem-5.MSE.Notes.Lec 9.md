## Properties of packing crystals
1. FCC
    * Total atoms - 4
    * Coordination number - 12
    * Packing density - 74% 
    * Packing Style - A-B-C-A-B-C
2. BCC
    * Total atoms - 2
    * Coordination number - 8
    * Packing density - 68%
3. HCP
    * Total atoms - 6
    * Coordination number - 12
    * Packing density - 74%
    * Packing Style - A-B-A-B

## 
* **Burger**
    * For an Edge dislocation, the Burgers vector and the line are perpendicular and in the slip plane
    * For the Screw dislocation they are parallel
    > _The Burgers vector is significant in determining the yield strength of a material by affecting solute hardening, precipitation hardening and work hardening. The Burgers vector plays an important role in determining the direction of dislocation line._
* Miller indices is a plane
* Burger vector AKA alpha vector
* b=2r (b= burger vector, r= radius of atom)
## Surface imperfection
1. **Internal**
* **Grain boundaries**
    * **Single crystal** - cristalinatory preserved till long distance
    * **Polycrystalline materials** - till some distance
    1. Grow the crystal - nucleation. 1 nucleus - single crystal, opposte too. 
    2. For poly crystals, there will be different grains in different pattern/orientation seperated by grain boundaries.
    3. GB till 2 to 4 atomic diameters
    4. atoms are tightly packed in grains THAN GB.
    5. low grain atomic packig, mor n more atoms can diffuse in grain boundaries

    * **Amorphous** - very short distance
    * Grain size number - AMERICAN STANDARD TESTING MATERIAL (ASTM)
        * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-18-23-29-29.png)
        * N =number of grains per square inch
        * G = grain size number - ranking
* **Tilt Boundaries**
* **Twin Boundaries**
* **Stacking Faults**
2. External
